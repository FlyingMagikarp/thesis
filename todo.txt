### TODO ###
# COMPAS
- add caucasian field to dataset and retrain ai
	- easiest way probably: separate into 2 df, white & non white
	- add field with 1 to white and 0 to non white df
	- combine
	- to csv gg ez
/\ Done
Analysis is the same as with the old dataset

- look at dispo and try that method to check impact of each field on model
\/

- logistic regression on new dataset
/\ Done
better result without 'score_factor'. better = more biased

- general analysis on new dataset
	- metrics
	- ratio did rec vs not
	- same ratio but gender specific
	- same ratio but race and gender specific
	- generate numbers in jupyter nb for later graph generation if needed
/\ Done
Have for all and for each gender:
	- Ratio positive negative
	- ratio of races to total
	- ratio of positive for each race

- expand test dataset
	- make dict for easier removal of not needed fields(race, gender etc)
	- more combinations
\/

- expand test script
	- make it easier to compare output
\/

# Credit
- repeat the same from compas, should be easy copy paste
